[Pages 1-5] The article "The Dangers of Artificial Intelligence" by Velibor Božić, published as a preprint in May 2023, discusses both the transformative potential and significant risks of AI. While AI can improve healthcare, education, efficiency, and productivity, it also poses dangers such as bias, lack of transparency, unemployment, malicious use, and over-dependency. Bias in AI can perpetuate discrimination, for example in hiring or criminal justice decisions, leading to unfair treatment of marginalized groups. Lack of transparency in AI decision-making undermines trust, especially in critical areas like healthcare and law enforcement. AI-driven automation threatens jobs, particularly for low-skilled workers, potentially exacerbating inequality. Malicious uses include autonomous weapons, deepfakes spreading misinformation, and cybercrime automation. Over-reliance on AI risks diminishing human critical thinking and decision-making abilities.

To mitigate these dangers, the author advocates for responsible and ethical AI development through regulations, ethical frameworks, auditing, accountability, collaborative human-AI development, education, and awareness. Examples of uncontrolled AI use causing harm include biased facial recognition, autonomous vehicle accidents (e.g., the 2018 Uber fatality), predictive policing biases, and discriminatory hiring algorithms. Tools to control AI use include government regulations, ethical guidelines, auditing mechanisms, stakeholder collaboration, and public education.

The conclusion emphasizes the need for a balanced approach that harnesses AI's benefits while minimizing risks such as inequality and privacy loss. Implementing oversight, transparency, and ethical standards can ensure AI serves society positively. The article references key studies and reports, including works by Buolamwini & Gebru (2018) on bias, the World Economic Forum (2020) on jobs, and Brundage et al. (2018) on malicious AI use.
